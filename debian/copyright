 The copyright status of this collection is a bit complicated, since the
 symbols come from various sources, each having different copyright owners.

 Most of the vectorized symbols are loosely based on the low-resolution
 "standard" bitmap symbol set as distributed by Stephen Smith, WA8LMF. That
 set is used by most APRS software around the world. The low resolution of
 those symbols does not allow direct vector conversion, so I've drawn new
 symbols in a similar layout. The vector versions try to mimic the original
 appearance and colours, with the intention of keeping the set recognizable
 and familiar to existing users. In some cases the vector versions are
 probably similar enough to the originals, so that they cannot be considered
 "original work" by myself. In some of these cases, the originals are probably
 also mimicking someone else's design.

 The original symbols do not come with any information on their licensing.
 They've been distributed with a lot of APRS software over time, but I don't
 know who designed which symbol originally. Most likely all of them are drawn
 by one of:

 Roger Barker, G4IDE, "original set provided with UI-View" (SK)
 Steve Dimse, KH4G, "U.S. customary set"
 Stephen Smith, WA8LMF

 Some symbols I obtained from other sources, such as Wikipedia. In those cases
 I picked SVG versions which allow commercial reuse (source known, and the
 work is placed on public domain, or with a CC license which allows adaptation
 and commercial reuse).

 Some symbols are vectorized versions of product or brand logos. The copyright
 of those is owned by the respective companies (Apple, Microsoft, Kenwood),
 and each of those may have some opinions on how the logos are used. Please
 check for yourself if you can use them or not.
